EBSD-Image is a free open-source software to analyze EBSD diffraction patterns 
and mappings. 
It is built on top of `RML-Image <http://rmlimage.com>`_, an image analysis 
freeware. 
It therefore combines image analysis routines and tools specific to EBSD such 
as an engine capable of analyzing EBSD diffraction patterns. 
It is written in `Java <http://java.com>`_ (cross-platform) and has a graphical 
and command line interface.

EBSD-Image was developed as part of the master's thesis project of Philippe T. 
Pinard at `McGill <http://www.mcgill.ca>`_ (Montréal, Québec, Canada) under the 
supervision of Prof. Raynald Gauvin and the active collaboration and support of 
Marin Lagacé and Pierre Hovington from the 
`Research Institute of Hydro-Québec <http://www.ireq.ca>`_ 
(Varennes, Québec, Canada).

The objectives of this project were to develop a platform for the EBSD 
community to further improve the technique. 
In contrast with other EBSD software, EBSD-Image is flexible and extensible. 
Users can decide how to analyze diffraction patterns by having access to the 
sequence of operations and all the parameters. 
New algorithms can be easily implemented inside the engine. 
Furthermore, all file formats used are either human readable or public (easy to 
implement in other software). 
Finally, all the features are well documented inside this wiki.

Installation package for Windows, Mac OS and Linux Debian are available to 
:ref:`download`, as well as a Java executable jar. 
For more information, please refer to the :ref:`documentation` page.
