How to use the desktop
======================

The desktop is what we call the whole program area.

There are several items composing the desktop:

  1. Menu bar
  2. :ref:`main-toolbar`:
     This toolbar holds icons for the most often used imaging functions in 
     EBSD-Image.
  3. :ref:`utility-toolbar`:
     This toolbar holds functions that the author finds most useful in his 
     own work.
  4. :ref:`plugins-toolbar`:
     This toolbar holds functions related to EBSD-Image and other modules.
  5. Map button bar:
     Each button represents a map loaded on the desktop. 
     The pressed button represents the selected map. 
     Pressing one button selects the corresponding map and brings it to the 
     front of the desktop.
  6. :ref:`multimap-tree`:
     List of all :ref:`multimap` opened including :ref:`ebsdmmap`.
  7. Progress bar:
     Shows the progress of long operations. 
     An operation must be at least one second long for the progress bar to 
     show any progress.
  8. :ref:`map-window`:
     Button and information around a map window.
