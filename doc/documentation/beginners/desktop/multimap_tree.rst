MultiMap tree
=============

The multimap tree shows all the opened :ref:`multimap`'s and the 
:ref:`maps <maps>` contained in those MultiMaps.
To open a MultiMap, use the *Open* button or File-Open and browse for a ZIP 
file.

Once a MultiMap is opened, a map inside a MultiMap can be opened by clicking on 
its name in the MultiMap tree.
By right-clicking on one of the :ref:`multimap`'s, a context menu appears
allowing the user to save, save as, rename and add new maps to the multimap.

Note that some maps cannot be removed in :ref:`ebsdmmap`.
