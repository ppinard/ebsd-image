BinMap
======

Binary map (*BinMap*) is a monochromatic image. 
The pixels in this type of map can only have two states: **ON** (value = 1) 
or ***OFF*** (value = 0). 
Usually, ***ON*** pixels are shown in white and ***OFF*** pixels are shown in 
black. 
*BinMap*'s are created from thresholding or can be used as a mask to select 
an area from another map.
