IdentMap
========

In an *IdentMap* (short for identification map), the pixels are not considered 
as individual points but are grouped to form objects. 
All pixels touching each others are assigned the same value as they are all 
part of the same object. 
An *IdentMap* is therefore the representation of objects, i.e. regions, in an 
image. 
A maximum of 65,534 objects can be identified in an *IdentMap*.
