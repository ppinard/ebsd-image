RealMap
=======

A *RealMap'' is a 32-bit image. 
Each pixel represents a real number stored as a float. 
Another way to describe a *RealMap* would be as a matrix of real numbers. 

A *RealMap* is stored in a binary format RMP (short for Real MaP), 
proprietary to RML-Image, since no file format is commonly available to store 
real numbers. 
For visualization purpose, a *RealMap* can be easily compressed to a 
:ref:`bytemap`.
