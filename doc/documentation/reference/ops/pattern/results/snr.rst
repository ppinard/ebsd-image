Signal to noise ratio
=====================

The signal to noise ratio is a measure of the quality of an image.
It is calculated using the following equation :cite:`Frank1975`:

.. math::

   Q = \frac{r}{1-r}

where *r* is the correlation between the odd and even lines of the diffraction
pattern.
The calculations are identical to the signal to noise ratio of images.
This technique was used to evaluate the quality of electron micrographs,
:cite:`Joy2002`, but it can also be applied to diffraction patterns.
