Create a SMP file
=================

.. note::

   This method should only be used if you are not importing diffraction 
   patterns from HKL Channel 5 or TSL OIM software. 
   For those software, please refer to :ref:`import-hkl` and :ref:`import-tsl`
   guide, respectively.

A few important notes about SMP file before launching the conversion:

  * All images must be grayscale images (8-bit)
  * All images must have the same dimensions (same width and same height)

To convert a series of diffraction patterns to a single SMP file:
  
  * In the menu *PlugIns* in EBSD-Image, select *EBSD* and then 
    *Create an SMP file*
  * Select the directory containing all the image files
  * Select where to save the SMP file
