RGBMap
======

A *RGBMap* is a 24-bit image or more commonly known as a true color image. 
Each pixel contains three 8-bit values for the red, green and blue colors. 
Each value represents the intensity of the red, green and blue component of 
the color of the pixel. 
*RGBMap*'s are not used in any image analysis routine. 
Their only purpose is to input or output information to and from other 
types of :ref:`maps <maps>`.
